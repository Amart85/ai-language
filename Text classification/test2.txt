Number of firms in critical financial distress rises sharply

A growing number of UK businesses are at risk of going under, as costs spiral and loan repayments come due, a report has found.

Construction and hospitality are the sectors struggling most, according to insolvency the report.

Loan repayment schedules should be extended to ease the pressure, it said.

The government said it had given businesses an "unprecedented package of support" and increased flexibility in paying back loans.

In the first three months of this year there was a 19% rise in businesses in critical financial distress compared to the start of 2021, the report by Contoso said.
